# docker-php-js-debuggger

A minimal and configurable Docker-based setup for developing and debugging PHP and frontend JavaScript applications.  
Includes `PHP`, `Apache`, `Xdebug`, `launch.json`, `Docker Compose`, and `Dockerfile` with full IDE integration support (tested with Visual Studio Code).

Supports backend PHP debugging with Xdebug inside Docker and frontend JavaScript debugging by attaching directly to Chrome via VS Code’s Chrome Debugger extension—no Node.js runtime required.
